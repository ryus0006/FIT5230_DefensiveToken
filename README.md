When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to perform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt
injection, becomes a significant threat. By injecting instructions
into the data accessed by the system, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an arbitrary task directed by the
attacker. To secure the system, test-time defenses, e.g., defensive
prompting, have been proposed for system developers to attain
security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are
much less effective than training-time defenses that change the
model parameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken,
a test-time defense with prompt injection robustness comparable
to training-time alternatives. DefensiveTokens are newly inserted
as special tokens, whose embeddings are optimized for security.
In security-sensitive cases, system developers can append a few
DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a
minimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern, developers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system
remains the same as there is no defense, generating high-quality
responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens, if released alongside the model,
allow a flexible switch between the state-of-the-art (SOTA) utility
and almost-SOTA security at test time.

+ Install environment dependencies: add our optimized DefensiveTokens to public model's vocabulary
> git clone https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/DefensiveToken \
> cd DefensiveToken \
> conda create -n defensivetoken python==3.12 transformers==4.45.2 torch==2.5.1 \
> conda activate defensivetoken \
> python setup.py
+ Play with our optimized DefensiveTokens: specify ```model_name``` with one of the ```meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, tiiuae/Falcon3-7B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct``` for single-sample inference
> python demo.py [model_name]
+ Reproduce DefensiveToken test results: please use [Meta_SecAlign](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Meta_SecAlign). 
    + Specify ```-m model_path``` in Meta_SecAlign with ```model_name-5DefensiveTokens```, e.g., ```meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-5DefensiveTokens```, which is generated by ```python setup.py```. 
    + Use ```"role": "system"``` for trusted instruction and ```"role": "user"``` for untrusted data, i.e., change Meta_SecAlign [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Meta_SecAlign/blob/main/utils.py#L261-L265), which uses ```"role": "user"``` for trusted instruction and ```"role": "input"``` for untrusted data.
    + Add ```add_defensive_tokens=False``` when calling ```tokenizer.apply_chat_template```, i.e., add it on Meta_SecAlign [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Meta_SecAlign/blob/main/utils.py#L261-L265).
